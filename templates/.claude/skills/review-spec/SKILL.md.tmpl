# Review Spec: $ARGUMENTS

**Reference:** [Background execution rules](_shared/background-execution.md)

## Workflow

1. **Read the spec**: `specs/$ARGUMENTS/SPEC.md`

2. **Launch spec-reviewer** with `run_in_background: true`
   ```
   Task(spec-reviewer):
     Review specs/$ARGUMENTS/SPEC.md
     Return summary under 400 tokens.
   ```
   WAIT for notification.

3. **Process result**:
   - **APPROVED**: Inform user spec is ready
   - **NEEDS_CLARIFICATION**: Questions asked via AskUserQuestion
   - **REJECTED**: Report rejection reason

4. **On approval**:
   ```markdown
   ## Spec Approved: $ARGUMENTS

   Ready for orchestration: `/orchestrate $ARGUMENTS`
   ```

## What spec-reviewer Checks

- Completeness of all sections
- Clarity and lack of ambiguity
- Testability of acceptance criteria
- Feasibility given existing codebase
