# Testing Guide

This skill references the standards system. Read the testing standards:

```bash
cat standards/testing/philosophy.md
cat standards/testing/patterns.md
```

For backend testing:
```bash
cat standards/backend/testing.md
```

See `standards/testing/` directory for all testing standards.

Standards evolve over time. The `/learn` skill promotes proven testing patterns from `.chaos/learnings.md` into these files when a pattern appears 3+ times across tasks.
