# Simulated task context for /learn evaluation
#
# Scenario: Developer just completed a task to add email validation.
# The task went smoothly but revealed a pattern about the codebase.

## Task Summary

Task: add-email-validation
Status: Merged (PR #42)

## What Happened

Implemented email validation for the user registration form. Added a new
`validateEmail` method to the existing `InputValidator` class and wrote
tests covering valid emails, invalid formats, and edge cases.

## Observations

1. The codebase has an existing `InputValidator` class in `src/utils/validator.ts`
   that handles all input validation. New validation should extend this class
   rather than creating standalone functions.

2. Test patterns follow a `describe/it` structure with clear naming like
   "should accept valid X" and "should reject invalid X". Tests are colocated
   in a parallel `tests/` directory structure.

3. The `ValidationError` class from `src/utils/errors.ts` is the standard way
   to represent validation failures. It includes a `code` field for programmatic
   handling.

## Key Takeaway

Always check `src/utils/` for existing utility classes before creating new ones.
The codebase prefers extending existing utilities over creating new standalone
helpers.
